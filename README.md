# OrigamiSimulator
Simulating active origami structures with multi-pyhsics behaviors including 
compliant creases, inter-panel contact, and electro-thermally actuated creases. 


Main Features of the package:

(1) Provides five different loading simulation methods: Newton-Raphson method,
    Displacement controlled method, Generalized displacement controlled method,
    self folding method, and electro-thermal actuation method. 
    
(2) Allows users to create customized loading schemes with arbitrary number and 
    sequence of the providev five loading methods. 
    
(3)	Simulates compliant creases in active origami and provides automated Meshing 
    code for compliant creases.

(4)	Simulates inter-panel contact induced mechanical behaviors within origami.

(5) Simulates heat transfer in origami systems, and can capture the electro-
    thermo-mechanically coupled actuation of active origami creases. 


Using the Code:

PLEASE ADD THE "00_SourceCode" IN TO THE PATH. For standard mechanical simulation 
of origami, please check the selected simulaiton example from the JMR paper and
PRSA paper in "01_MechanicalLoadingExample".

For simulation of the folding electro-thermally active origami, please check the
example codes in "02_ThermalLoadingExample".
