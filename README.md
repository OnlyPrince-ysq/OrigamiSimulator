# OrigamiSimulator
Simulating the mechanical behavior of origami structures with contact, compliant creases, and multi-physics 
behaviros associated with the elctro-thermal actuation 

PLEASE ADD THE "00_SourceCode" IN TO THE PATH.


Main Features of the Code:



(1)	Simulate Compliant Creases in Origami Patterns

(2)	Automated Meshing for Compliant Creases

(3)	Simulate Contact in Origami patterns

(4)	Provide 4 solvers for mechanical loading of origami including:
    Newton-Raphson loading method, Displacement controlled method, Generalized displacement controlled method,
    and a Newton-Raphson solver for self folding

(5)	Non-rigid support available

(6) Simulate Heat Transfer in Origami Systems

(7) Provide a solver for thermal loading: Solve the equilibrium configuration under applied heating power



Using the Code:

For standard mechanical simulation of origami, please check the selected simulaiton example
from the JMR paper and PRSA paper in "01_MechanicalLoadingExample".

For simulation of the folding electro-thermally active origami, please check the
example codes in "02_ThermalLoadingExample".
