# OrigamiSimulator
Simulating the mechanical behavior of origami structures with contact, compliant creases, and multi-physics mechanisms

PLEASE ADD THE "00_SourceCode" IN TO THE PATH.


Main Features of the Code:

(1)	Simulate Contact in Origami patterns

(2)	Simulate Compliant Creases in Origami Patterns

(3) Simulate Heat Transfer in Origami Systems

(4) Simulate Thermally Active Origami Folding

(5)	Automated Meshing for Compliant Creases

(6)	Solver for both folding and loading available

(7)	Non-rigid support available


Using the Code:

For standard mechanical simulation of origami, please check simulaiton example
for the JMR paper and PRSA paper in "01_SimlationsForPRSA" and "02_SimulationsForJMR".

For simulation of the folding electro-thermally active origami, please check the
example codes in "03_SimulationForThermal".
